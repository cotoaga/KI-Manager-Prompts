## ðŸŽ¯ CORE SPECIFICATION (Elements 1-13)
*Essential for every prompt - start here*

### **1. PROMPT ID**
**Purpose**: Version tracking like software development  
**Format**: Domain-Function-Version (e.g., HR-RECRUIT-003)  
**Examples**:

**Replace with your ID**: `[YOUR-DOMAIN-FUNCTION-VERSION]`

---

### **2. PURPOSE** 
**Purpose**: Strategic "why" - clear objective beyond "do something"  
**Missing from typical frameworks**: Most never ask WHY you're doing this  

**Template**: 
```
To [SPECIFIC GOAL] in order to [BUSINESS OUTCOME] by [METHOD/APPROACH]
```

**Examples**:
- To identify fraud risks in transaction data in order to prevent financial losses by statistical anomaly detection
- To explain complex technical concepts in order to enable non-expert decision-making by structured simplification
- To optimize resource allocation in order to reduce costs by 15% by data-driven recommendations

**Replace with your purpose**: `[YOUR SPECIFIC GOAL AND BUSINESS OUTCOME]`

---

### **3. CONTEXT**

Stakeholders: [WHO WILL USE/BE AFFECTED BY RESULTS]
Timeline: [URGENCY/DECISION DEADLINES]
```

**Example**:
```
Organization: Mid-size aviation company, 200 employees, GDPR compliance required
Environment: Regulated industry, risk-averse culture, first AI implementation
Stakeholders: Risk managers, compliance officers, executive leadership
Timeline: Monthly reporting cycle, decisions needed within 48 hours
```

**Replace with your context**: `[YOUR ORGANIZATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT]`

---

### **4. SYSTEM INSTRUCTION**
**Purpose**: Intelligent persona activation - not generic "expert for everything"  
**Avoid**: Fantasy roles like "successful billionaire entrepreneur"  
**Focus**: Relevant, specific expertise

**Template**:
```
Adopt the perspective of [SPECIFIC ROLE] with [YEARS] years experience in [DOMAIN].
Prioritize [KEY SKILLS/APPROACHES] when analyzing problems.
Consider [SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS/STANDARDS] in all recommendations.
```

**Examples**:
- Adopt the perspective of a senior fraud analyst with 10+ years experience in aviation finance. Prioritize statistical rigor and regulatory compliance when analyzing transaction patterns.
- Act as a change management consultant with 15+ years experience in digital transformations. Consider stakeholder psychology and organizational culture in all recommendations.

**Replace with your role**: `[YOUR SPECIFIC EXPERT PERSPECTIVE]`

---

### **5. INSTRUCTION**
**Purpose**: Concrete, executable action commands  
**Structure**: Verb + Object + Method + Success Criteria  

**Template**:
```
[ACTION VERB] the [INPUT OBJECT] by [METHOD/APPROACH].
Prioritize results by [CRITERIA].
Ensure outputs meet [QUALITY STANDARDS].
If [CONDITION], then [ALTERNATIVE ACTION].
```

**Examples**:
- Analyze the transaction dataset using statistical outlier detection. Prioritize results by potential financial impact. Ensure all flagged items include confidence scores above 80%.
- Create a 3-phase implementation plan using change management best practices. Prioritize quick wins in phase 1. Ensure each phase has measurable success metrics.

**Replace with your instructions**: `[YOUR SPECIFIC ACTION COMMANDS]`
